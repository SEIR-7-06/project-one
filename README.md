## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past couple of weeks together! For this project you will build a full stack web application using Express, Node, EJS, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a full-stack web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate an understanding of the topics covered during this course so far.
* Build a polished, published website you can share in your portfolio.  

You will be working **in groups of 2 or 3** for this first project. Show us what you've got!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Express APP** Build an Express Application that renders HTML pages from EJS Templates.
* **RESTful Routes** Design your CRUD routes using the [REST](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-sei-1/express-dynamic-routes#restful-routing-preview) convention.
* **Templating** Use EJS to render objects from MongoDB in the browser as HTML templates.  
* **MongoDB** Persist at least one model to a Mongo Database with **full CRUD functionality**. If you decide to use two models, use a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between models. You can choose to reference or embed your data.
* **Git** 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
* **Code Style** Write professional-looking code. Follow the [Airbnb Javascript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* **Visual Design** Use Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, Skeleton, or another CSS framework to make your front-end snazzy. First impressions matter!
* **Documentation** Write a README.md that would make an employer excited to hire you. Screenshots are encouraged. See the [example readme](./example-readme.md) for a suggested structure, or these examples here: [more readme files](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wc-seir-1207/Project_Planning_Examples).

## PLANNING DELIVERABLES

See the [planning deliverables](./planning.md) document for more information on the planning steps you should take.

Before you begin coding you will need to have your planning deliverables approved by an instructor.

These include
  * **MVP** - Put in writing a clearly defined **Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) Scope**. What can you reasonably accomplish in a week? Anything outside of MVP can be added to your planning materials as Stretch Goals.
  * **Wireframes** for _every_ page. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the page will include.
  * **User Stories** - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
  * **Database Models and ERD** - Create an **Entity Relationship Diagram**. List the attributes you'll include in your schemas and what type of data each attribute will be. Draw an [Entity Relationship Diagram](./readme-assets/erd.png) to illustrate the fields you will have on your models and the relationship(s) between models. If you will have a relationship, note whether you plan to reference or embed related data.
  * A **Feasibility Check** for any bonus feature you'd like to complete.


Once your project has been approved, create a **GitHub Repo** for your project and [add your teaching team as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

## BONUS IDEAS  
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app, but *please talk to an instructor* beforehand:

* **Front-End JavaScript** Include front-end JavaScript for user interactivity or animation.
* **Image Upload** Use a 3rd party library like [Upload Care](https://uploadcare.com/) to allow users to upload images to your site.
* **More Models or Relationships** Add another model to your project or create a new relationship between your models.
* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Front-End Data Validation** Validate data on the front-end by handling incorrect form inputs during create/update. For example, when a form is submitted, check that a field has some text in it, or that its value is a number.
* **Back-End Data Validation** Validate data on the back-end using mongoose's [built-in validations](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html#built-in-validators), or make your own custom validation.
* **Model Methods** Level up your models by adding a method to one of your schemas.  For example, a person schema with `firstName` and `lastName` can have a `fullName` method (see mongoose docs on [instance methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) and [static methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics)).
* **Authentication** Enable users to store account information and signup, login, and logout.
* **Sass** Use a CSS pre-compiler to write more imperative CSS.
* **Whatever else inspires you!**

## TIMELINE

> DO NOT START CODING UNTIL YOUR PROJECT IS APPROVED. CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE APPROVED ON THIS SPREADSHEET

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

#### Code must be...
* Clean   
  - no unused or commented-out code   
  - proper spacing and indentation  
* Modular and well organized   
  - use the module pattern with `module.exports`  
  - separate large tasks into shorter functions
* Appropriately commented
  - use comments to plan, but remove the unnecessary comments for your professional portfolio
  - prefer a well-named variable or function to a comment

## FINAL DELIVERABLES

* Completion of the **core requirements**
* A link to your **source code on GitHub**
* A `README.md` file that serves as your **project documentation** (this is important!)
* A **10 minute presentation**, in the company of friends, illustrating:
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - A few lines of code you want to share with your classmates
    - Words of Wisdom

## Presentation Tips
* Please zoom your browser window to 150%.
* Please set your Text Editor font to at least 20.0 pixels.
* And speak up!
